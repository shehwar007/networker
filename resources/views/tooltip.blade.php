    A connection is:</br></br>
    An existing client for whom you are not currently providing a service; or
    Someone who has or might refer you to a potential client.</br></br>

    Also, exclude connections for specific opportunities you are currently pursuing.</br></br>

    The connection may be an individual or a group of individuals.

</div>

<div id="tool_type" class=" tippy-popper tippy-tooltip tippy-content text-left">

    A connection type is as follows:</br>
    Type A1. Higher ROTI score/Higher relationship score and therefore requires less attention</br></br>
    Type A2. Higher ROTI score/Lower relationship score and therefore requires more attention. </br>
    </br>
    Definitions:</br>
    </br>
    ROTI = return on time invested. That is, the short- or long-term value the connection could</br>
    provide verse the time and effort to develop the connection. Value returned could be business</br>
    or introductions to business. Also, consider the likelihood of the connection delivering that return.</br>
    </br>
    ROTI score = Determined by benchmarking the connection against your most valuable client who represents</br>
    the best return on time invested. That client is rated 10/10. Give your connection a ROTI score out of</br>
    10 compared to your benchmark client. A higher ROTI score for a connection is 7-10/10</br>
    </br>
    Relationship score = Determined by benchmarking the connection against your biggest fan.</br>
    That is, the person with whom you have the strongest relationship because you have a lot of chemistry,</br>
    and they find you highly credible. That person is rated 10/10. Give your connection a relationship score</br>
    out of 10 compared to your benchmark connection. A higher relationship score for a connection is 7-10/10.</br>
    Attention required = The time, effort and frequency of contact needed to maintain and build the relationship.</br>
    </br>
    Note:</br>
    </br>
    - If you have just met a connection then clasiify them as a A2 even if the initail contact was very positive.</br>
    You need to meet with them 2 or 3 more times before classifying them as an A1 assuming the chemistry is still</br>
    strong and they still find you credible.</br>
    </br>
    - Your frequency of contact with a strong connection can affect the score. That is, a strong connection may need</br>
    attention if the duration since last contact is over six months.</br>

</div>

<div id="tool_date" class=" tippy-popper tippy-tooltip tippy-content text-left">

    The indictor will turn red if the duration since you were last in contact with a:</br></br>

    A1 type connection is 6 or more months</br></br>

    A2 type connection is 3 or more months.</br></br>

    In that case there is risk the relationhsip will start to weaken. Therefore make </br>
    contact by carrying out an appropriate activty.


</div>

<div id="tool_activity" class=" tippy-popper tippy-tooltip tippy-content text-left">
    Activities on the drop-down list are ordered as follows:</br></br>

    -The activities towards the top half tend to feature direct contact, require more time and effort,</br>
    and have more impact on chemistry and credibility.</br></br></br>

    -The activities towards the bottom half tend to feature remote contact, require less time and effort,</br>
    and have less impact on chemistry but can build credibility.</br></br></br>

    Seminars and webinars tend to be an exception. They take more work and may be stressful, but you have</br>
    more direct contact. This activity also means more opportunity to build chemistry and credibility with</br>
    a higher number of connections.</br></br></br>

    Also, ensure you choose activity:</br></br></br>

    - You can realistically complete for all listed A1 and A2 connections over a 1–3-month period. That is,</br>
    avoid trying to do too much given your other commitments.</br>
    - You and the connection enjoy.</br></br></br>

    - Represent the best ROTI. Note return could mean immediate business or business over the long-term because </br>
    it builds a relationship or raises profile. Therefore, be clear on what return is realistic for an activity.</br>
    For instance, the realistic return for presenting a seminar is raising profile rather than immediate business.</br>

<div id="tool_help" class=" tippy-popper tippy-tooltip tippy-content text-left">


    Effective networkers are always finding ways to help their connections. Therefore ensure your</br>
    activity includes help for the connection. Ways to help include the following:</br></br>

    Connect them to somebody – Can you connect them to a potential client or provider who might resolve a need?</br>
    Maybe you can connect them to others who work in their field or share the same interests?</br></br>

    Give them insights – Can you give them insights that are relevant to their business, role or</br>
    personal interests?</br></br></br>

    Give them a sounding board – Can you spend time with them so they can reflect on their business</br>
    challenges or goals and therefore crystallise their thinking?</br></br></br>

    Give them something – Is it appropriate to gift them something for Xmas or their birthday etc?</br>
    Personal gifts might relate to their interests e.g., sport, food, or gadgets. Maybe gift something</br>
    relevant to their business role or provide an incentive or reward?</br></br></br>

    Give them an opportunity to contribute – Maybe you are working on a project, and they would appreciate</br>
    being involved? This might include surveys.</br></br></br>

    Give them updates - Maybe they would appreciate being kept in the loop on certain developments.</br></br>

    Support them – Can you provide moral or practical support for a project they are working on?</br></br>

    Recognise their contributions or achievements – Acnowledge or reward their contributions where appropriate.</br>
    LinkedIn is a good source for opportunities to recognise achievements such as an award, promotion, or new</br>
    role. Maybe you can provide a testimonial?
